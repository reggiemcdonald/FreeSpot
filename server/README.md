# lock-my-bike
The server for the bike lock occupancy tracking system
---
This is a template for the bike lock server. Clone the repo before tomorrow to familiarize yourself. I've already pre-defined much of the project structure.

You will note the following:
- This is a NodeJS Express Project
- I've added TypeScript to package.json
- TSLINT has been enabled (but I've allowed console.log)

To get started:
- `git clone`
- open the project (ideally in WebStorm)
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

Active endpoints:
- `/`
- `/bike-racks`
- `/bike-racks/:id`
